Quality Verification
===============================================================================
Overview:
    This batch of queries verifies that the Gold layer is sound, coherent, and 
    free of anomalies. Specifically, it covers:
      - Ensuring each dimensionâ€™s surrogate key is distinct.
      - Confirming every fact record correctly references its dimensions.
      - Checking that the star schema relationships hold.

Instructions:
    - Run these checks regularly.  
    - If any rows return, investigate and correct the underlying data issues.
